description: In cancer patients, blood plasma can carry circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) fragments originating from tumor cells, offering non-invasive access to somatic genetic alterations in tumors. The ctDNA profile of a cancer patient is clinically informative in at least two major ways. Firstly, the profile can provide information about specific actionable mutations that can guide therapy. Secondly, the profile can be used to infer tumor growth dynamics by estimating the amount of ctDNA in the blood. This latter information offers a promising non-invasive approach to track disease progression during clinical trials or therapy, offering a real-time tool to adjust therapy. In our lab, we are developing machine-learning based approaches to detect and quantify ctDNA in blood samples (<a class='txt' href='https://clincancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/26/12_supplement_1/44.abstract'>Guo et al. 2019</a>, Zhu et al. 2020). Secondly, we are using ctDNA profiles to study mechanisms of treatment resistance to chemotherapy and targeted therapy. We are also co-investigators in the new cancer liquid biopsy consortium in Singapore, CaLiBRe.
