title: Non-coding mutations in cancer
category: Cancer genomics, Non-coding
description: Cancer primarily develops because of somatic alterations in the genome. However, the non-protein-coding genome, comprising more than than 98% of the human genome, remains mostly uncharted in cancer genomics. We have previously analyzed complete genome sequences of 863 human tumors from The Cancer Genome Atlas and other sources to systematically identify noncoding regions that are recurrently mutated in cancer (<a class="txt" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25261935">Weinhold & Jacobsen, et al. (2014)</a>). We developed and applied new frequency- and sequence-based approaches to comprehensively scan the genome for noncoding mutations with potential regulatory impact. For example, these methods identified recurrent mutations in regulatory elements upstream of PLEKHS1, WDR74 and SDHD, as well as previously identified mutations in the TERT promoter. We are planning to refine and apply our methods to even larger patient cohorts to improve both discovery and characterization of non-coding cancer driver mutations.
