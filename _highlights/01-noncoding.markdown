title: Non-coding mutations in cancer
category: Cancer genomics, Non-coding
description: Cancer primarily develops because of somatic alterations in the genome. However, the non-protein-coding genome, comprising more than 98% of the human genome, remains mostly uncharted in cancer genomics. We have previously analyzed complete genome sequences of 863 human tumors from The Cancer Genome Atlas and other sources to systematically identify noncoding regions that are frequently mutated in cancer (<a class="txt" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25261935">Weinhold & Jacobsen, et al. (2014)</a>). We are further developing and applying new frequency- and sequence-based approaches to comprehensively scan cancer genome for noncoding mutations with potential regulatory impact (e.g. <a class="txt" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28408461">Hu et al. 2017</a> and Guo et al. 2018).
