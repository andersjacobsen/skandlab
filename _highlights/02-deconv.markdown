title: Biomarker and Target Discovery
description: The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a multi-faceted cellular environment that both constrains the evolving tumor and plays a pivotal role in tumor progression and therapeutic response. We are developing computational approaches to quantify and describe this environment. We are exploring fundamental propoerties of the TME, such as signaling between (<a class='txt' href='https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/835512v1.abstract'>Ghoshdastider et al.</a>) and metabolism of (<a class='txt' href='https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/835512v1.abstract'>Rohatgi et al. 2020</a> ) cancer and stromal cells inside tumors. We are using similar approaches to study biomarkers of drug response and potential novel therapeutic targets.
