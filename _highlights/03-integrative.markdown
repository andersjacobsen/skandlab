description: We are interested in developing integrated clinical, experimental, and computational approaches to solve important challenges in medical genomics, especially cancer treatment. The advent of affordable high-throughput sequencing and molecular technologies are now allowing us to study cancer genomics and biology directly in large cohorts of patient tumors. As a former member of the <a class="txt" href="http://cbio.mskcc.org/research/sander-research-group/index.html">Sander group</a> at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, we have experience from participation in several tumor characterization projects in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Here we have contributed data analysis and tools for management and analysis of the massive cancer genomics datasets (see <a class="txt" href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cgdsr/index.html">CGDSR</a>, <a class="txt" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22588877">Cerami 2012</a>, <a class="txt" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23550210">Gao 2013</a>). Additionally, we have collaborated with multiple clinical cancer research groups on integrative analysis to address relevant clinical questions (<a class="txt" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24285872">Hakimi 2013</a>, <a class="txt" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24332042">Li 2013</a>, <a class="txt" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25748237">Barlin 2015</a>,  <a class="txt" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25676555">Hakimi 2015</a>). We plan to engage in new cancer genomics collaborations with excellent experimental and clinical groups at GIS and in Singapore.
