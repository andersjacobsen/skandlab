                    <b>Computational cancer genomics</b><br>We are a newly started computational biology group at Genome Institute of Singapore (GIS). We are particularly interested in developing and applying relevant computational and statistical approaches for cancer research that take advantage of large-scale genomic, molecular, and clinical data.

                  <b>Integrated & collaborative approach</b><br>Our focus is especially on integrated clinical, experimental, and computational approaches to solve important challenges in medical genomics, especially cancer treatment. We accomplish this in close collaboration with excellent experimental and clinical groups at GIS and in Singapore.

                  <b>Deciphering non-coding elements</b></br>Non-protein-coding regulatory elements and transcripts take up a large fraction of the human genome, but their function and disease relevance are not well understood. We use computational approaches to identify and characterize cancer-causing non-coding elements from rich tumor molecular profiles.
