                    <b>Computational Precision Oncology</b><br>We develop and apply computational approaches to study cancer and how anti-cancer drugs work in patients. We develop algorithms for cancer genomics and study how machine learning approaches can enable biomarker discovery and data-driven clinical decision support. To accomplish this, we work closely with clinical teams in Singapore and abroad.

                  <b>Cancer Liquid Biopsies</b></br>Profiling of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in blood offers a non-invasive approach to detect cancer and monitor disease progression. By profiling ctDNA over time, we study how tumors respond to treatments. We are also building machine learning models to aid detection of cancer mutations as well as detection and tracking of ctDNA levels in blood samples.

                  <b>Tumor Systems Biology</b><br>Signaling between cancer and non-malignant cells of the tumor microenvironment is key to tumor progression. We are developing integrated experimental and computational methods to study tumors at a systems level. We use these approaches to discover biomarkers of immunotherapy and predict novel anti-cancer drug targets.
