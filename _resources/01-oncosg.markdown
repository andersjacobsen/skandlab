description: The field of cancer research is advancing at a rapid pace due to the declining cost of next-generation DNA sequencing. Massive DNA sequence data, complex molecular profiles, and rich clinical data are being generated from thousands of cancer patients worldwide. Several such projects are also underway in Singapore. However, considerable computational expertise and resources are required to integrate and mine these datasets. This presents a significant barrier for clinicians and use of this data to study cancer precision medicine. To meet this demand, we are developing the Singapore Oncology Data Portal (OncoSG). OncoSG will enable integration, visualization, analysis, and sharing of cancer genomics datasets in Singapore. This will speed-up translation of cancer genomics data into new biological insights and clinical applications. OncoSG currently stores data for more than 50,000 patient tumor samples, including more than 2,000 samples from Singapore.
