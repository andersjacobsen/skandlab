description: Somatic Mutation calling method using a Random Forest (SMuRF) integrates predictions and auxiliary features from multiple somatic mutation callers using a supervised machine learning approach. SMuRF is trained on community-curated matched tumor and normal whole genome sequencing data. SMuRF predicts both SNVs and indels with high accuracy in genome or exome-level sequencing data. Furthermore, the method is robust across multiple tested cancer types and predicts low allele frequency variants with high accuracy. In contrast to existing ensemble-based somatic mutation calling approaches, SMuRF works out-of-the-box and is orders of magnitudes faster.
