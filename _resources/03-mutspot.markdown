description: Recurrence and clustering of somatic mutations (hotspots) in cancer genomes may indicate positive selection and involvement in tumorigenesis. MutSpot performs genome-wide inference of mutation hotspots in non-coding and regulatory DNA of cancer genomes. MutSpot performs feature selection across hundreds of epigenetic and sequence features followed by estimation of position- and patient-specific background somatic mutation probabilities. MutSpot is user-friendly, works on a standard workstation, and scales to thousands of cancer genomes. See <a class="txt" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41525-020-0133-4">Guo et al. 2020</a>.
