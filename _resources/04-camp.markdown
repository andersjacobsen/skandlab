description: The Cancer Metabolic Pathway viewer (CaMP) contains metabolic activity profiles of cancer cells in vivo, non-malignant (stroma) cells within tumors, normal tissues and cancer cells in vitro. Metabolic profiles of cancer cells and stromal cells for 20 solid tumor types is estimated using a data deconvolution approach (Ghoshdastider, 2019) based on transcriptomes of 7865 tumors obtained from the cancer genome atlas (TCGA). Metabolic profiles of normal tissues is estimated using transcriptomes of 815 normal tissue samples from TCGA and genotype-tissue expression (GTEX). 620 cancer cell line from the cancer cell line encyclopedia (CCLE) transcriptomes are used to estimate the metabolic activity of cancer cells in vitro. The database contains KEGG maps of 55 metabolic pathways based on 1845 metabolic genes.
