description: CITE (Crosstalk Interactions within Tumor microEnvironment) provides a database and dynamic visualization of ligand-receptor (LR) signaling interactions within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Crosstalk between ligands and receptors on cancer and stromal cells were estimated in the TME of 20 solid tumor types, based on cancer and stroma specific expression estimated using a tumor transcriptome deconvolution approach.
